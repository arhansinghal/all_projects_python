We also calculated the precision, recall and f1-score values. They were undefined. Based on these three parameters, we concluded that our model needs a lot of improvement because it did not classify the stars having a planet as `2` rather it labelled every star as `1`.\n","\n","In this lesson, we will process the data before deploying a prediction model so that it can learn the properties of the different stars through the training dataset.\n","\n","Now, there is no right approach to the data processing method. It is an iterative process. It comes through experience and domain knowledge. (*The term 'domain' means a particular field of industry or academics*). For e.g., if you are a banker, then you would have the knowledge of the finance field. Similarly, if you are an astrophysicist, then you would have the technical knowledge of astronomy, quantum mechanics, optics etc. So, based on the knowledge of a respective field, data should be processed before deploying a prediction model.\n","\n","In this class, we will perform the following data processing exercises:\n","\n","1. Data Normalisation\n","\n","2. Fast Fourier Transformation\n","\n","3. Oversampling\n","\n","Finally, we will check if the Random Forest Classifier model is still providing the expected results. If not, then we will deploy a much stronger prediction model called XGBoost Classifier. Generally, it doesn't require a lot of data pre-processing but it requires heavy computation resources such as high RAM, CPU, GPU and at least 4 cores processor. Thanks to Google Colab notebook, we have a decent computation power to run the XGBoost Classifier algorithm.\n","\n","Hence, the XGBoost Classifier model must be used only when the data processing is not helping a prediction model in making accurate predictions.\n","\n","Let's run all the codes in the code cells that we have already covered in the previous classes and begin this class from the **Activity 1: Data Normalisation** section. You too run the code cells until the first activity.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eq9mAtEg9cpZ"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OwzryU6Zie33"},"source":["#### Loading The Datasets\n","\n","Create a Pandas DataFrame every time you start the Jupyter notebook.\n","\n","Dataset links (don't click on them):\n","\n","1.
