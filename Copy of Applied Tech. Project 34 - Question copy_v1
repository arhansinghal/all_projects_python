Imagine that you have popped the balloon. The ground beneath the balloon gets soaked because of the water and creates a wet circular patch. As you move farther away from the centre of the patch, in the radially outward direction, the ground is less wet or the extent of wetness reduces.\n","\n","This gradual decrease in the extent of wetness of a ground can be modeled using a Python list. \n","\n","**Examples**\n","\n","```\n","[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] ➞ [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n","```\n","\n","In the above example, i.e., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the extent of wetness at the centre is `4` (the middle element of the list) immediately after the balloon is popped where `4` denotes the ground is very wet and `0` denotes the ground is dry. \n","\n","Over the time, the wet patch expands slowly in the radially outward direction with the center of the patch being most wet and periphery of the patch being least wet.
