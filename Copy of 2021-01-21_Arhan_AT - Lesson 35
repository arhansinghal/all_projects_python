Why?\n","\n","Recall that in the case of the string concatenation, we have to use the `+` operator several times to get one string. Additionally, you have to beware of spaces and also have to convert a non-string data-type object to a string before concatenation. This is such a big hassle if too many strings are to be concatenated.\n","\n","Similarly, while printing the values of multiple entities using the `print()` function, you have to separate them with commas. Again quite a handful tasks especially in case of long strings.\n","\n","The `format()` function doesn't require that much effort to generate a clean string. It allows you to create one long string with proper punctuation and plug-in the required values at the respective places in the long string.\n","\n","Let's learn this function with the help of an example. We have a CSV containing the data of the 20 professional marathon runners (men's category) who participated in Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM) 2020.\n","\n","Our task is to create a certificate for each runner using the `format()` function. The certificate should read the following:\n","\n","```\n","Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020\n","\n","      CONGRATULATIONS\n","\n","This is to certify that DERARA HURISA                    \n","BIB No. 19\n","officially completed the marathon \n","(distance 42.2 km) \n","in the men's category \n","with a finish time of 2:08:09 \n","and rank 1.                   \n","--------------------------------------------------\n","```\n","\n","Here's the link to the CSV file containing data for each runner:\n","\n","https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/whitehat-ds-datasets/tmm-2020-race-results/TMM2020_RaceResults.csv\n","\n","\n","**How to approach this task?**\n","\n","1.
