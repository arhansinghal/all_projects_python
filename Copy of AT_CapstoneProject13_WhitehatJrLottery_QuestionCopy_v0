The lottery seems a speedy way of becoming rich. Lotteries refer to games where we need to guess which numbers will be drawn from a pool of options. They are designed in such a way that there are extremely low chances of winning a jackpot amount.\n","\n","During advertising, many companies that run lotteries target individuals belonging to the low income and debt-ridden groups. Lotteries can incur heavy losses to your income yet studies revealed that financially challenged people are more likely to purchase lottery tickets as compared to the wealthy people. They spend a large amount of their meagre income to purchase lottery tickets. These lotteries not only exploit the desires of the underprivileged of becoming rich but also worsens their current financial condition. Lottery houses use the lottery mathematics which is nothing but the probability and expected value to design their lottery games in a way that chances of winning the lottery are extremely low.\n","\n","Let us try to understand the underlying math involved in a Lottery game."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gguw7YCDz3gz"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bLWi0FX7gr8r"},"source":["### Problem Statement\n","\n","Imagine a situation in which WhiteHat Jr announced its lottery game.
