The lottery seems a speedy way of becoming rich. Lotteries refer to games where we need to guess which numbers will be drawn from a pool of options. They are designed in such a way that there are extremely low chances of winning a jackpot amount.\n","\n","During advertising, many companies that run lotteries target individuals belonging to the low income and debt-ridden groups. Lotteries can incur heavy losses to your income yet studies revealed that financially challenged people are more likely to purchase lottery tickets as compared to the wealthy people. They spend a large amount of their meagre income to purchase lottery tickets. These lotteries not only exploit the desires of the underprivileged of becoming rich but also worsens their current financial condition. Lottery houses use the lottery mathematics which is nothing but the probability and expected value to design their lottery games in a way that chances of winning the lottery are extremely low.\n","\n","Let us try to understand the underlying math involved in a Lottery game."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gguw7YCDz3gz"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bLWi0FX7gr8r"},"source":["### Problem Statement\n","\n","Imagine a situation in which WhiteHat Jr announced its lottery game. The amount of the jackpot prize to be won is INR 25,000,000 (or INR 25 million).\n","\n","Suppose you want to play this lottery and you bought a ticket for it which costs INR 250.

You have to mark 10 different numbers out of those 70 numbers in both the leaves and submit the second copy of the filled ticket back to WhiteHat Jr.\n","\n","<img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/lottery_ticket_filled.png' width=500>\n","\n","After a week in a lucky draw, 10 balls will be drawn randomly one-by-one from an urn of 70 balls.

Here's the list of all the conditions of winning the prizes:\n","\n","- If all 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win **INR 25,000,000, the jackpot prize**.\n","\n","- If 9 out of the 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win INR 2,500,000.\n","\n","- If 8 out of the 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win INR 250,000.\n","\n","- If 7 out of the 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win INR 25,000.\n","\n","- If 6 out of the 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win INR 2,500.\n","\n","- If 5 out of the 10 numbers that you marked on your lottery ticket matches with the ones on the balls drawn, you will win INR 250.\n","\n","- In all other cases, you win nothing.\n","\n","Find out the amount you are expected to win or lose on an average per lottery ticket.\n","\n","**Note:** The student must first attempt the problem on their own and then they should take the help of the teacher to solve it."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"80LMG6Mkdevt"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i0_8waPmiJDd"},"source":["#### Getting Started\n","\n","Follow the steps described below to solve the project:\n","\n","1.
