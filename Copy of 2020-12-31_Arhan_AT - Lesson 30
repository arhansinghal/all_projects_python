Later you use the same CSV file to do your work either in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel or in some other spreadsheet processing software. In the process, we will also learn another data-structure called Python dictionaries which becomes an integral data-structure in the domain of data engineering (to acquire the raw data in real-time or non-real-time and make it usable by structuring and organising it) and data analysis.\n","\n","So far, you learnt about Python lists in detail and Python tuples very briefly.
