We learned that arithmetic operators don't work on Python lists in the same way they work on a NumPy array. So if we have to perform such arithmetic operations on list items we have to either convert the list into an array or use the `for` loop. But we can create a whole new numeric data-structure out of the Python list on which we can perform arithmetic operations.
